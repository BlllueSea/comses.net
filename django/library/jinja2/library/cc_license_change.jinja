    <p>
        We are attempting to phase out the use of Creative Commons licenses for models
        stored in the CoMSES Model Library, as
        <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-apply-a-creative-commons-license-to-software">
            they are not recommended for software.
        </a>
        To this end, we are asking members to update the licensing of their models and
        are providing an easy way to do so by relicensing all of your models at once to
        a more appropriate software license. If you prefer a different license to the default
        alternatives listed below, you may update the license by editing a release's metadata
        at any time.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The CC BY license will be replaced with the
            <a href="https://opensource.org/license/MIT" target="_blank">MIT license</a>,
            a commonly used permissive license that retains the attribution requirement.
        </li>
        <li>
            All other CC licenses will be changed to the
            <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">
                GNU General Public License v3.0</a>, a widely used copyleft license that
            provides a rough equivalent to the ShareAlike restriction.
            There are no commonly used software licenses that include the same restrictions
            as NonCommercial or NoDerivatives.
        </li>

            Please review the following changes to the licensing of your models stored
