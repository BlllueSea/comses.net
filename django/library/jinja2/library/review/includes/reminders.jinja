        <i class='fas fa-exclamation-triangle'></i> Peer reviews may only occur on
        <strong>unpublished model releases</strong> so that you can continue to revise your submission based on
        reviewer guidance.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-0">
        If you have already published your model <strong>a new draft release will be created</strong> as an
        exact copy. On completion, the release can then be published to supersede unreviewed versions.
    </p>
</div>
<p>Before submitting your peer review request, please ensure that your model conforms to the following <a
        href="/reviews/" target="_blank">review criteria</a>:</p>
<ul class="mb-4">
    <li>
        <strong>Clean source code</strong> that is well-commented, uses meaningful variable names, consistently
        formatted, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Detailed narrative documentation</strong> containing equations, flowcharts, or other diagrams in
        a structured format like the <a href="https://www.ufz.de/index.php?de=40429" target="_blank">ODD protocol</a> or
        equivalent. Published journal articles generally are not considered sufficient narrative documentation
        and pose copyright issues for us to host.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Runnable</strong> without any changes to the downloaded package. Take care to remove absolute
        paths from your source code and see the following note for referencing data files.
    </li>
</ul>

    <p><strong>Note on Uploaded Data</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-0"><small>CoMSES Net stores uploaded data files in
            <code>&lt;project-root&gt;/data/</code> and code in
            <code>&lt;project-root&gt;/code/</code>. This means that references to your uploaded data
            files within your model will typically be via a relative path like
            <code>"../data/my-input-data.csv"</code>. If you uploaded a zipfile with a nested directory
            structure you may need to go up several directories to get to the project root before
            descending back down into the data directory, depending on where your source code files
            exist within that nested directory structure (e.g., a Python script in a
            <code>src/python/</code> directory would have to reference uploaded data files in
            <code>"../../../data/"</code>). This can be mitigated by including your data in your source
            code zipfile and referencing relative paths to your input data directly in your code and
            ignoring the CoMSES data upload slot.
