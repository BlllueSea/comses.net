Dear {{ invitation.invitee }},

In order to promote good practices and high quality computational models, the CoMSES Net Computational Model Library allows authors of models in the library to request peer review of their models. 

As a member of CoMSES Net, would you be willing to review the computational model [{{ release.title }}]({{build_absolute_uri(release.share_url)}})?

#### Description

#### Review Criteria

You can accept or decline this invitation on [your custom invitation page]({{ build_absolute_uri(invitation.get_absolute_url()) }}). This invitation will expire by {{ invitation.expiration_date|format_datetime }} - we would appreciate it if you could let us know before that time so we can continue to provide model peer review in a timely manner.
