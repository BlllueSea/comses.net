Dear {{ invitation.invitee }},

In order to promote good practices and high quality computational models, the CoMSES Net Computational Model Library allows authors of models in the library to request peer review of their models. 

As a member of CoMSES Net, would you be willing to review the computational model [{{ release.title }}]({{build_absolute_uri(release.share_url)}})? A brief description of the model follows:

{{ release.description }}

The process is not very time-intensive and involves a review of the source code and documentation to ensure it meets basic standards for readability and whether the model can be run.

{% include "library/review/includes/review_criteria.jinja" %}

You can accept or decline this invitation at [your custom invitation page]({{ build_absolute_uri(invitation.get_absolute_url()) }}). This invitation will expire by {{ invitation.expiration_date }}.

On behalf of the editors@comses.net, thank you for being a part of the CoMSES Net community!
