Dear {{ invitation.invitee }},

In order to promote good practices and high quality computational models, the CoMSES Net Computational Model Library allows authors of models in the library to request peer review of their models. 

As a member of CoMSES Net, would you be willing to review the computational model [{{ release.title }}]({{build_absolute_uri(release.share_url)}})?

The CoMSES Net Computational Model Library's peer review system is not a time-intensive process and consists of a checklist to verify that a computational model's source code and documentation meets baseline standards derived from ["good enough practices"]({{build_absolute_uri("/resources/guides-to-good-practice/")}}) in the software engineering and scientific communities we serve. Through this process we hope to foster higher quality models shared in the community for reuse, reproducibility, and advancement of the field as well as serve as an exemplar in the [emerging practice of software citation](https://www.force11.org/software-citation-principles).

You can accept or decline this invitation on [your custom invitation page]({{ build_absolute_uri(invitation.get_absolute_url()) }}). This invitation will expire by {{ invitation.expiration_date|format_datetime }} - we would appreciate it if you could let us know before that time to help us provide model peer review in a timely manner.

On behalf of the editors@comses.net, thank you for being a part of the CoMSES Net community!
