Dear {{ invitation.invitee }},

In order to promote good practices and high quality computational models, the CoMSES Net Computational Model Library allows authors of models in the library to request peer review of their models. 

As a member of CoMSES Net, would you be willing to review the computational model [{{ release.title }}]({{build_absolute_uri(release.share_url)}})?

This process is not intended to be time-intensive and consists of a review of the source code and documentation to ensure it meets baseline standards for readability, documentation, and whether the model can be run.
