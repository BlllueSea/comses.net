Dear {{ review.submitter.name }},

Congratulations! The peer review of your model [{{ release.title }}]({{ build_absolute_uri(release.get_absolute_url()) }}) 
is now complete and your release has been marked as peer reviewed. In the coming months we will be building a DOI
registration workflow that will automatically assign a DOI to all peer reviewed models but if you need a DOI immediately
please feel free to [contact us]({{ slugurl('contact') }}).

Thank you for submitting your computational model for review to CoMSES Net! We hope you will be willing to serve as a
reviewer of model code as well in future peer reviews.

Best regards,
The CoMSES Net Editors
