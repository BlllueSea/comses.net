{% set release = invitation.review.codebase_release %}

Dear {{ invitation.invitee }},

We have received a request to peer review the following computational model and invite you to review it:

    [{{ release.title }}]({{ build_absolute_uri(release.share_url) }})

{% include "library/review/includes/review_criteria.jinja" %}

Please let us know if you are willing to perform a peer review of this model and its associated
documentation at [your custom invitation page]({{ build_absolute_uri(invitation.get_absolute_url()) }}).

This invitation will expire by {{ invitation.expiration_date }} and we would appreciate if you would let us know if you are willing to review the computational model by that date.

On behalf of the editors@comses.net, thank you for being a part of the CoMSES Net community!
