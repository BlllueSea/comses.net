The CoMSES Net Computational Model Library's peer review system is not a time-intensive process and consists of a checklist to verify that a computational model's source code and documentation meets baseline standards derived from ["good enough practices"]({{build_absolute_uri("/resources/guides-to-good-practice/")}}) in the software engineering and scientific communities we serve. Through this process we hope to foster higher quality models shared in the community for reuse, reproducibility, and advancement of the field as well as serve as an exemplar in the [emerging practice of software citation](https://www.force11.org/software-citation-principles).

Reviewers should evaluate the computational model according to the following criteria:

1. Can the model be run without expending too much effort? This may involve compilation into an executable, resolving input data dependencies or software library dependencies - all of which should be clearly documented by the author.
2. Is the model sufficiently documented with a detailed narrative protocol like the [ODD protocol](http://www.ufz.de/index.php?de=40429) or equivalent? Narrative documentation should present a cogent high level overview of how the model works as well as essential internal details and assumptions and ideally be complete enough to allow other computational modelers to replicate the model and its results without having to refer to the source code.
3. Is the model source code well-structured, formatted and "clean" with relevant comments in addition to documented inputs and expected outputs? Unused or duplicated code, overuse of global variables, or other [code smells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell) are some example criteria to consider. Clean, well-documented code makes it easier for others to reuse, review, and make improvements to the code.

In this review process you do not need to assess whether the model is theoretically sound, has scientific merit or is producing correct outputs. Of course, if you spot any red flags in the code please feel free to raise them in your private correspondence with the review editor.
