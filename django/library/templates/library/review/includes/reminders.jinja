Before submitting your peer review request please double check to make sure your computational model conforms to the
following [review criteria](/reviews/):

1. Has clean source code, e.g., remove unused commented out code, use consistent indentation and formatting in your
source code, etc.
2. Has accompanying detailed narrative documentation like the [ODD protocol](https://www.ufz.de/index.php?de=40429) or equivalent. Please note that a published journal article related to your model does not qualify as sufficient narrative documentation and will generally not pass peer review. Published articles also pose as potential copyright issues.
3. Can be run without any changes to the downloaded package. Please take care to remove absolute paths from your source code. **NOTE:** the CoMSES Net Computational Model Library organizes your uploaded data files in a `../data/` directory relative to your model which is placed in a `code/` directory. This means that references to your uploaded data files within your model will typically be a relative path like `../data/my-input-data-file.csv` if your source code is a single file. If you uploaded a zipfile with a nested directory structure you may need to go up several layers to get to the project root before descending back down into the data directory, depending on where your source code files exist within that nested directory structure (e.g., a Python script in `src/python` would reference its uploaded data artifacts via `../../data`).
