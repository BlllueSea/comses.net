Dear CoMSES Member,
        
We are planning to phase out Creative Commons licenses in the CoMSES Model Library due to their [unsuitability for software](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-apply-a-creative-commons-license-to-software) and have determined that one or more of your submissions to the CoMSES Computational Model Library currently use a Creative Commons license. In order to ensure that your published computational models are properly licensed for reuse, we strongly urge to consider selecting an alternate OSI-approved open source license for your computational models. 

We have set up a straightforward process to transition all of your submissions at once to an appropriate software license. You can access this service at the following link (you will need to sign in to comses.net first):

    [{CC_LICENSE_CHANGE_URL}]({CC_LICENSE_CHANGE_URL})

Thank you for helping us make model software more accessible and reusable, and do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or require further assistance.

Sincerely,
The CoMSES Net Team
        """
