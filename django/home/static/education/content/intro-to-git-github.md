# Prerequisites

1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you do not already have one.
2. Download and install a Git client like [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
3. Download and install [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml) if you'd like to run the `boids.nlogo` model. This GitHub classroom uses the [NetLogo commons Flocking model](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Flocking) as a running example.
4. Download and install a plain text editor like [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to resolve merge conflicts in NetLogo code. NetLogo will fail to launch and error out if you try to open a NetLogo model with merge conflicts.
