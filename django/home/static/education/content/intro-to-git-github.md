# Before You Begin

If you don't already have one, [create a new GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

If you are new to Git please download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to follow along with the GitHub Classroom assignments. We will use a [NetLogo](https://classroom.github.com/a/bLyjPEf6) model as an example. You will also need a plain text editor like [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to resolve git merge conflicts in NetLogo code as NetLogo will report an error if you try to open files with merge conflicts within them.

# Getting Started
